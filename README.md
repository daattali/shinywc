# inputknob

To see a demo of the web component purely in HTML, open `inst/wc/inputknob/lib/input-knob-demo.html` (make sure to run a server to not receive CORS errors).

The web component is described by a schema in `inst/wc/inputknob/lib/input-knob.json`, and this schema is used to create a Shiny binding.

To see a demo of the Shiny binding to the component, run `shiny::runApp('inst/shiny/demo')`.
